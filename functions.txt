Unstaging a file
//git restore --staged functions.txt --> git reset HEAD -- functions.txt

Looking at the commit history
// git log

//-r or -R: This is the recursive option that tells rm to delete the directory and its contents recursively.
//-f: This is the force option that tells rm to ignore nonexistent files and arguments, and never prompt before removing.


// git remote add origin "link"
Now origin will serve as the link

To return to a previous commit
// git checkout <hashcode>

// git push origin master <the branch you want to push>
